     * @details This is the only topic which can provide positioning information without having a GPS fix; though this
     * can be a big enabler please note the caveats of using this topic:
     * - The topic will use an origin that does not have a global reference, and is not published to the SDK.
     * - The topic uses a combination of VO and compass heading to identify the X-Y axes of its reference frame. This means
     * that if your compass performance is not good in an environment, there is no guarantee the X-Y axes will point to
     * North and East.
     * - The actual directions of the X-Y axes are currently not published to the SDK.
     * - If during a flight the compass performance were to change dramatically, the orientation of the X-Y axes may change
     * to re-align with North-East. The aircraft's position in X and Y may exhibit discontinuities in these cases.
     * - The reference frame is referred to as the Navigation Frame - Cartesian X,Y axes aligned with N,E directions on a best-effort
     * basis, and Z aligned to D (down) direction.
     * - A health flag for each axis provides some granularity on whether this data is valid or not.
     *
     * The key takeaway from these details is that this topic provides a best-effort attempt at providing position
     * information in the absence of absolute references (GPS, compass etc.), without guarantees of consistency if
     * environmental conditions change. So if your application is confined to a stable environment, or if you will
     * have GPS and compass available at all times, this topic can still provide useful data that cannot be otherwise
     * had. If using for control, make sure to have guards checking for the continuity of data.
     *
     * @note Since this topic relies on visual features and/or GPS, if your environment does not provide any of these
     * sources of data, the quality of this topic will reduce significantly. VO data quality will reduce if you are too high
